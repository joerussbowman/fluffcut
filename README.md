fluffcut
========

Repository for fluffcut, an rss feed aggregation service.

fluffcut is probably one of many projects starting after the announcement by
Google they will be killing Google Reader. As a regular user of Reader
I've decided to replace that service with something similar for my
own use. If others choose to use it too, great. 

The name comes from a domain I already own.

Currents status: Defining requirements.
